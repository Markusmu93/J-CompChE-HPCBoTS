# Process-Constrained Batch Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains the code used for the research presented in the paper titled "Process-constrained batch Bayesian approaches for yield optimization in multi-reactor systems" by Markus Grimm, Sébastien Paul, and Pierre Chainais, published in Computers & Chemical Engineering in 2024. The paper discusses advanced methodologies for optimizing yield in multi-reactor chemical systems using hierarchical process-constrained batch Bayesian optimization techniques.
